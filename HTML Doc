          <blockquote> 
            <p>"I think Erdős had the idea that the problem sits in a larger context. So many of his harmless-looking problems grew into something much larger. You never know when you plant a seed, a little acorn, will it just turn into a weed, or will it be a great oak tree? You don’t know."
